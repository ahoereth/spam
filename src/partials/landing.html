	<h1>Welcome<span ng-show="(loginform.username||user)&&(!demo)">, {{loginform.username}}</span>!</h1>
	<p>This is your personal <span class="text-success">study planning machine</span>. It will help you to keep track of your courses, grades and credits throughout your course of study; Not only of the stuff you already accomplished but also which fields still might need some work. Find new interesting courses for the next semesters and generate your transcript of records with ease when applying for your semester abroad.</p>

<div class="col-md-4">
	<h2>Work in progress</h2>
	<p>The study planning machine is a living project. You can follow the progress and contribute to it yourself on <a href="https://github.com/ahoereth/spam">GitHub</a>. For the time being I also take bug reports directly per mail at <a href="mailto:ahoereth@uos.de">ahoereth@uos.de</a>.</p>
